# Contributing to DLOC

## Coding Rules

* No CRLF line endings, LF only. Set your Git `core.autocrlf` to `true` on Windows, to `input` on Linux ([details](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-all)). 

* Format code with [dartfmt](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartfmt/) and use line_length = 120.
